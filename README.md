#  MelonLoarder AutoExec

This mod let you start scripts or programs, when the game starts. It will create an 'autoexec' folder with 'autoexec.config' file.  After putting your scripts into the folder, you can define in the config what file types you want to run.

Originally created for a friend, but later seems like other people inverted to use it so i made it public. After vrc made modding impossible, modified to be a'universal' mod.

~~Im a system enginer not a programmer, thse sorce code is a mess.~~
